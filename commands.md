#Playing NuCTex
NuCTex uses a verb-noun command syntax, where verbs are the main commands known
by the game and nouns act as subcommands.

##Movement
The main movement command is `go`. `go` can be combined with the nouns `north`,
`south`, `east`, and `west` to take you in the direction you want to go. `n`,
`s`, `e`, and `w` also work as substitutes for the directions.

##Environment
`look` is the base command to view things. Currently, you can look `around` you
to see what is in the room, or, alternately, use `look room`. While looking at
yourself, called with `look me` won't do much yet, it's something you can do.

##System
`quit` is the command issued to quit the game cleanly.
